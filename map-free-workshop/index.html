                The Map-free Visual Relocalization workshop investigates topics related to
                metric visual relocalization relative to a single reference image instead of
                relative to a map.
                This problem is of major importance to many higher level applications, such as
                Augmented/Mixed Reality, SLAM and 3D reconstruction.
                It is important now, because both industry and academia are debating whether and
                how to build HD-maps of the world for those tasks. Our community is working to
                reduce the need for such maps in the first place.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                We host the first Map-free Visual Relocalization Challenge 2024 competition with
                two tracks:
                map-free metric relative pose from a single image to a single image (proposed by
                <a href="https://github.com/nianticlabs/map-free-reloc">Arnold et al. in ECCV
                    2022</a>) and from a query sequence to a single image (new).
                While the former is a more challenging and thus interesting research topic, the
                latter represents a more realistic relocalization scenario, where the system making
                the queries may fuse information from query images and tracking poses over a short
                amount of time and baseline.
                We invite papers to be submitted to the workshop.

            <h3>About the Challenge</h3>
            <hr/>
            <p>
                Based on feedback from senior community members, we plan to extend the Map-free
                benchmark for the challenge with a sequence-based scenario.
                Therefore, the challenge will consist of two tracks:<br/>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; 1. The original, single query frame task published with the paper;<br/>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; 2. A new track with multiple (~8) query frames and their metric
                tracking poses. <br/>
                The second track is motivated by the observation that a burst of images, cap turing
                small motion, can be recorded while staying true to the map-free scenario: No
                significant data capture or exploration of the environment.
                At the same time, the burst of images allows the application of multi-frame depth
                estimation and contains strong hints about the scene scale from the IMU sensor on
                device.
                We are creating a second version of the test set and leaderboard for this track.

                        part of the Visual Positioning Service (VPS).
                        Devices with Google’s augmented reality capabilities can leverage VPS to
                        enable global scale location aware experiences such as ARCore CloudAnchors
                        and GoogleMaps LiveView.
                        Simon earned a doctorate at the Autonomous Systems Lab at ETH Zurich with a
                        focus on visual navigation and localization algorithms for robotics, mobile
                        devices, and autonomous cars.
                        As visiting researcher, Simon contributed central pieces to core algorithms
                        of Google’s ARCore.
                        In talks at TEDx Zurich, ThinkingDigital, Zurich Minds, and scientific
                        conferences, Simon has provided a behind-the-scenes view of the ARCore

                        Professor Victor Adrian Prisacariu received the Graduate degree (with first
                        class hons.) in computer engineering from Gheorghe Asachi Technical
                        University, Iasi, Romania, in 2008, and the D.Phil. degree in engineering
                        science from the University of Oxford in 2012.<br/>
                        He continued here first as an EPSRC prize Postdoctoral Researcher, and then
                        as a Dyson Senior Research Fellow, before being appointed an Associate
                        Professor in 2017.
                        <br/>
                        He also co-founded <a href="https://6D.ai">6D.ai</a>, where he built APIs to
                        help developers augment reality in ways that users would find meaningful,
                        useful and exciting.
                        The 6D.ai SDK used a standard built-in smartphone camera to build a
                        cloud-based, crowdsourced three-dimensional semantic map of the world all in
                        real-time, in the background.
                        6D.ai was acquired by Niantic in March 2020. He is now Chief Scientist with
                        Niantic.
                        <br/>
                        Victor's research interests include semantic visual tracking, 3-D
                        reconstruction, and SLAM.
